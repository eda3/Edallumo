# Version 0.4.0 Patch Notes.

## A while back I made a discord bot in rust for displaying frame data and hitboxes and named it Baiken.

&#x200B;

So, today I am announcing the release of version 0.4.0.

What does this update have to offer I hear you typing.

&#x200B;

## Added support for nickname searching.

Previously you could only search by using a characters full name or with a part of it.

* Example before update: `b.f happy_chaos` or `b.f happy` or `b.f chaos`.

With this update you can _**also**_ use some predefined nicknames to achieve the same result.

* Example after update: `b.f hc` or all the previously mentioned methods.

List of nicknames can be viewed [here](https://github.com/yakiimoninja/baiken/blob/main/data/nicknames.json).

## Added a variety of new aliases for various moves.

Unfortunately I wasn't organizing them so keeping track was difficult. However that leads me to the third feature.

## Added a patch notes page.

As mentioned above, keeping track of the aliases was a bit difficult.

To solve that issue I created a folder inside the github project that will hold each version's patch notes.

The patch notes will include what's new, what's been removed and any new addition of nicknames or aliases.
