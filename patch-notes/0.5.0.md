# Version 0.5.0 Patch Notes.

### General
 - Season 2 is out but the new frame data will have to be updated gradually. \
 Meaning we'll need to wait for the chads at dustloop to bless us. \
 Support them if you can. They are doing gods work!

### Commands
 - Removed the command aliases `hit` and `hitbox` from `b.h`. \
 Although `b.h` and `b.hitboxes` still work.

### Move Aliases
 - `Happy Chaos`:
    - `Focus 214S H`: Removed alias `Fire` as it's a duplicate of the `Regular 236S H`. \
    `Focus Fire` can be used instead.

 - `Nagoriyuki`: \
   Since Nagoriyuki has a lot variation in his normals due to Blood Rage, aliases have now been added to distinguish them from each other.
 
    - `5H Level 1`: Added alias `5H`.
    - `5H Level 2`: Added alias `5H2`.
    - `5H Level 3`: Added alias `5H3`.
    - `5H Level BR`: Added alias `5HB`.

    - `2H Level 1`: Added alias `2H`.
    - `2H Level 2`: Added alias `2H2`.
    - `2H Level 3`: Added alias `2H3`.
    - `2H Level BR`: Added alias `2HB`.

    - `6H Level 1`: Added alias `6H`.
    - `6H Level 2`: Added alias `6H2`.
    - `6H Level 3`: Added alias `6H3`.
    - `6H Level BR`: Added alias `6HB`.

    - `j.H Level 1`: Added alias `jH`.
    - `j.H Level 2`: Added alias `jH2`.
    - `j.H Level 3`: Added alias `jH3`.
    - `j.H Level BR`: Added alias `jHB`.

 - `Goldlewis Dickinson`: \
   Same principle with Nagoriyuki adding more aliases to distinguish between specials and their leveled up counterparts.

   - `214S Level 1`: Added alias `D1`.
   - `214S Level 2`: Added alias `Thunderbird 2`, `Drone 2`,`D2`. 
   - `214S Level 3`: Added alias `Thunderbird 3`, `Drone 3`,`D3`.

   - `236S Level 2`: Added alias `Skyfish 2`, `Minigun 2`, `MG2`, `Gun 2`, `G2`.
      - Existing wrong alias `GL1` changed to `GL2`.
   - `236S Level 3`: Added alias `Skyfish 3`, `Minigun 3`, `MG3`, `Gun 3`, `G3`.

   - `720P`: Added alias `Down With The System 2`, `Super 2`.
   - `1080P`: Added alias `Down With The System 3`, `Super 3`.

   - `236236K Level 1`: Added alias `L1`.
